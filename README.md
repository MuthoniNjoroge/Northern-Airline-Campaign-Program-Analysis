## Introduction
‚úàÔ∏è This project dives deep into NLA's 2018 promotional campaign, aimed at boosting loyalty program enrollments. I explored how the campaign impacted membership growth, uncovered trends across different customer demographics, and analyzed its effect on summer flight bookings. By leveraging the power of DAX for advanced calculations and data visualization, this analysis provides key insights into the effectiveness of the campaign and offers actionable intelligence for optimizing future marketing strategies.

## Project Overview

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains customer loyalty program data from Northern Lights Air (NLA). The key data points include:

- **Loyalty program signups**
- **Enrollment and cancellation details**
- **Additional customer information (demographics, province, etc.)**

This data provides a comprehensive view of how the campaign influenced customer engagement with NLA‚Äôs loyalty program.

### Objectives
The primary goals of this project were to:

1. Assess the **impact of the campaign on loyalty program memberships** (both gross and net).
2. Analyze the **campaign‚Äôs success across different customer demographics**.
3. Determine the **campaign's effect on summer flight bookings**.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Dataset**: NLA Loyalty Program Data (2018)
- **power Bi**: For data visualization and analysis
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) **: To perform complex calculations
- 
### 1. Impact on Loyalty Program Memberships (Gross / Net)

To measure the impact of the campaign on loyalty program memberships, I used DAX to calculate both **gross** and **net memberships** after the campaign. A **line chart and stacked column chart ** was then employed to visualize these metrics over time, providing a clear view of the campaign‚Äôs effectiveness in driving memberships.

### 2. Campaign Adoption Across Demographics

To explore whether the campaign was more successful among certain demographics, I utilized several visualizations:
- A **tree map** to illustrate the impact of the campaign across different educational demographics.
- A **map** to show campaign adoption rates across various provinces.
- A **pie chart** to visualize the gender and marital status distribution of campaign participants.

These visualizations help pinpoint which segments of the customer base were most responsive to the campaign.

### 3. Impact on Booked Flights During Summer

I used DAX to calculate the number of flight bookings before and after the campaign, then determined the **percentage change** in bookings. This was visualized using a **card** for the percentage change and **bar charts and a water fall** to compare summer flights before and after the campaign. These insights highlight how the campaign influenced travel behavior during the summer season.

## Insights

- **Membership Impact**: The campaign significantly increased both gross and net loyalty program memberships, as seen in the upward trend on the line chart.
- **Demographic Success**: The tree map revealed that certain educational demographics were more responsive to the campaign, while the map and pie chart indicated higher adoption in specific provinces and among certain genders.
- **Flight Bookings**: The analysis showed a noticeable percentage increase in summer flight bookings following the campaign, with the card and bar charts clearly illustrating this positive trend.

## Key Takeaways

- The campaign was successful in boosting loyalty program memberships, with notable increases in both gross and net figures.
- Certain demographics, particularly based on education, location, and gender, showed higher campaign adoption, suggesting targeted marketing opportunities.
- The positive impact on summer flight bookings underscores the campaign‚Äôs effectiveness in not just enrolling new members but also in driving immediate revenue through increased bookings.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of NLA‚Äôs promotional campaign. By using DAX for in-depth calculations and visualizing the results through various charts, the analysis offers actionable intelligence for optimizing future marketing strategies. The findings could guide NLA in refining its loyalty program to maximize customer engagement and revenue. On to the next challenge! üí™
